/* --- RAM fast path for CPU loads ---
 *
 * interconnect_load32/16/8() spend most of their time deciding that an access
 * is a plain RAM read: an alignment test, a call into the debugger's read
 * watchpoint filter, the region mask, the stall charge, then ram_load*() in
 * another unit with a bounds check of its own. For the common case all of that
 * collapses to the five things below, and the result is the same value and
 * the same stall:
 *
 *   - misaligned: falls back, so the slow path raises the address error;
 *   - a read watchpoint is armed: falls back, so the debugger sees the access.
 *     read_watchpoint_count is the flag; debugger.c keeps it current whenever
 *     the list changes, and with it at zero the slow path's filter is empty and
 *     debugger_check_read_watchpoint() returns without doing anything;
 *   - not main RAM: falls back (scratchpad, I/O, ROM, expansion, unmapped);
 *   - otherwise: charge g_bus_ram_load_stall exactly as bus_charge_cpu_load()
 *     does for phys < 8 MB, and read the mirrored offset directly. ram_load*()
 *     can never reject an aligned offset below RAM_SIZE, so skipping it skips
 *     nothing.
 *
 * Callers keep their cache-isolation test (SR bit 16) in front of this, as
 * they had it in front of interconnect_load*(). Returns false when the caller
 * must take the slow path, which is then unchanged. */
