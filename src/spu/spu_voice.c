 * The sample decode is the pcsx-redux loop; the address, IRQ and loop handling
 * around it are written from the documentation:
 *
 *  - the IRQ address traps the block being *read*, at the moment it is read
 *    (:824). This compared against `curr_addr + 16`, the block after the one
 *    just decoded, so an IRQ address on the first block of a looping buffer
 *    never fired: the block that precedes it in memory is not part of the
 *    loop. That is the classic double-buffered SPU stream (:855-866), whose
 *    refill then never came.
 *  - Loop Start copies the current address to the repeat address, every time
 *    (:134-135, :165). A software write to the repeat address used to switch
 *    this off until the next Key On.
 *  - Loop End jumps to the repeat address after the block has been played, and
 *    sets ENDX (:136-138, :163). It used to jump only when this voice had seen
 *    a Loop Start since Key On, and to stop the voice otherwise, so a ring with
 *    no Loop Start flag, looped through a repeat address the game wrote before
 *    Key On, played once and went silent.
 *  - Code 1 (End without Repeat) still jumps, and also forces Release with the
 *    envelope at 0 (:164, :171). The voice keeps reading: "There's no way to
 *    stop the output" (:180).
 *
 * `decode` is false for a silent voice: the samples are not needed, only the
 * position, the flags and the IRQ check are.

 * What it changes against the code it replaces:
 *  - a linear decrease stops at 0 (:431-432, :480-481). It used to run on to
 *    -8000h, so a fade-out went through silence and came back at full volume
 *    with the phase inverted: the previous scene's sound "returning";
 *  - the phase bit (:419, :433-435, :498-503) inverts the step and picks the
 *    clamp. It was ignored;
 *  - an exponential increase above 6000h is a slower *linear* step (:455-462,
 *    :484-485), not a step proportional to the level;
 *  - all-ones step and shift never step (:466-467, :490-491).
 *
 * Two points the pseudo-code leaves implicit:
 *  - the counter is cleared when it steps. That is what makes a step every
 *    `1 SHL Max(0,ShiftValue-11)` cycles, the older formula the text says is
 *    right up to shift 26 (:493-496), and what the code here always did;
 *  - "/8000h" in the exponential decrease is taken as SAR 15, as in the ADSR
 *    envelope (spu_adsr.c), so a decaying level reaches 0 instead of stalling
 *    one step above it.
