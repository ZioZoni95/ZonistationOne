// Per-instruction BIOS ROM wait-state costing: ~24 extra cycles per word, from the
// MEMCTRL delay registers the guest itself programs (bus_memctrl_recalculate() in bus.c).
//
// ON since 2026-08-17. It was disabled for a long time because enabling it hung boot
// (the drive never got past its early reads), and the note here blamed an unidentified
// BIOS-interrupt / CD second-response race. That was the right suspicion in the wrong
// place: the CPU cost was correct all along and the drive was broken, in two ways that
// only a slow BIOS could expose (both fixed in cdrom.c / cdrom_commands.c).
//   1. Acknowledging an interrupt re-armed any deferred response at CDROM_MIN_INT_DELAY,
//      throwing its real deadline away — every seek, spin-up and read start answered
//      ~30 us after its command. With ROM-resident code running 25x slower, that reply
//      landed before the BIOS had finished the routine that issued the command.
//   2. Init charged an undocumented spin-down, putting its second response 821 ms out,
//      past the ~415 ms after which the BIOS retries Init — an endless retry loop.
//
// The measurement that decides whether this belongs on: boot milestones in emulated
// fields (the TTY lines carry the log's f-stamp) against a DuckStation Devel-build run
// of the same disc. Off, this machine reached `Execute !` at field 444 against
// DuckStation's 819 — 1.8x too fast, and up to 7x on the ROM-only phases. On, it reaches
// it at 765, and every milestone lands within ~4%.
