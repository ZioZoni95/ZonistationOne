 *   backend starts at its own defaults and the guest has no reason to re-send
 *   GP0(E2..E6). gpu_reapply_renderer_state() puts them back from Gpu, which is
 *   the authority for all of them.
 *
 *   The ImGui context — fonts, imgui.ini, the docking layout, the pinned
 *   watches. Only the two backend halves are recreated; the context is not
 *   touched, which is why the workspace comes back exactly as it was.
 *
 * The guest never notices: CPU, Interconnect, SPU and the drive are not
 * involved. No reset and no save state.
